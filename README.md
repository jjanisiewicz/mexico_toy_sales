## Mexico Toy Sales
This repository contains sales and inventory data for a fictional toy store chain in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

## SQL Queries 

In my queries, I wanted to get answers to:

1.Which product categories generate the highest profits? Are they the same across all store locations?

2.Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?

3.How much money is allocated in inventory in the toy stores? How long will it last?

4.What does grouping sales by time periods look like?

5.What is the average cost of products in each category?

6.What profit did each store generate?
